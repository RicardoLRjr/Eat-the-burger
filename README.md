 ## Usage Instructions:
 Follow the onscreen instructions, and you'll be able add a burger to the ready to eat table. Once you've added a burger to the ready to eat table, a button will pop up next to it that will allow you to eat it, which will send it to the "burgers that have been devoured" table. If you want to remove a burger from that section, for some reason, you can select the ready to eat button, and it will move back to the ready to eat table.
